## Introduction

E-mail notifications from [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) are rather brief and all the information is contained in the subject of the e-mail - the body is empty.

Slurm-Mail aims to address this by providing a drop in replacement for Slurm's e-mails to give users much more information about their jobs via HTML e-mails which contain the following information:

* Start/End
* Job name
* Partition
* Work dir
* Elapsed time
* Exit code
* Std out file path
* Std err file path
* No. of nodes used
* Node list
* Requested memory per node
* Maximum memory usage per node
* CPU efficiency
* Wallclock
* Wallclock accuracy

E-mails can be easily customised to your needs using the provided templates (see below).

You can also opt to include a number of lines from the end of the job's output files in the job completion e-mails (see below).

## Requirements

* cron
* logrotate
* Python 3.6 or newer
* Slurm 22, 23 or 24
* A working e-mail server

**Note:** earlier versions of Slurm may work but are not tested with this release of Slurm-Mail.

```

#### Other RPM Based Operating Systems

For other operating systems that use RPM packages you can create a package for your OS like so:

```bash
dnf -y install python36 rpm-build tar
git clone https://github.com/neilmunday/slurm-mail
slurm-mail/build-tools/build-rpm.sh
```

The RPM will be written to `~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch`.

### Ubuntu 20 and 22

Pre-built Ubuntu 20 and 22 packages are provided at [neilmunday.github.io/slurm-mail/repo](https://neilmunday.github.io/slurm-mail/repo/).

Add to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file the following line depending on your OS.

#### Ubuntu 20

```
deb [trusted=yes] https://neilmunday.github.io/slurm-mail/repo/ub20 ./
```

#### Ubuntu22

```
deb [trusted=yes] https://neilmunday.github.io/slurm-mail/repo/ub22 ./
```

#### Ubuntu24

```
deb [trusted=yes] https://neilmunday.github.io/slurm-mail/repo/ub24 ./
```

#### Install

Then install using `apt-get`:

```bash
apt-get install slurm-mail
```

#### Other Debian based Operating Systems

For other Debian variants you can create a package for your OS like so:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y fakeroot dh-python lintian lsb-release python3 python3-stdeb
git clone https://github.com/neilmunday/slurm-mail
slurm-mail/build-tools/build-deb.sh
```

At the end of the execution the location of the built package will be written to stdout.

To install the generated package for example:

```bash
apt-get install -y cron logrotate python3 slurm-client
dpkg --force-all -i /tmp/slurm-mail_4.3-ubuntu1_all.deb
```

### From source (as root)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neilmunday/slurm-mail
cd slurm-mail
python setup.py install
cp etc/logrotate.d/slurm-mail /etc/logrotate.d/
cp etc/cron.d/slurm-mail /etc/cron.d/
install -d -m 700 -o slurm -g slurm /var/log/slurm-mail
```

**Note:** Depending on your operating system's Python set-up, it is possible that `setuptools` might install Slurm-Mail to `/usr/local` rather than `/usr`.

### AWS Parallel Cluster

Slurm-Mail can be installed and automatically configured to work with [AWS Parallel Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) by using the [this recipe](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-hpc-recipes/tree/main/recipes/pcluster/slurm_accounting_with_email).

## Configuration

Slurm-Mail expects to find all of its config files in a directory called `slurm-mail`, with the following structure:

```bash
slurm-mail
├── slurm-mail.conf
├── style.css
└── templates
    ├── html
    │   ├── ended-array-summary.tpl
    │   ├── ended-array.tpl
    │   ├── ended-hetjob.tpl
    │   ├── ended.tpl
    │   ├── invalid-dependency.tpl
    │   ├── job-output.tpl
    │   ├── job-table.tpl
    │   ├── never-ran.tpl
    │   ├── signature.tpl
    │   ├── staged-out.tpl
    │   ├── started-array-summary.tpl
    │   ├── started-array.tpl
    │   ├── started-hetjob.tpl
    │   ├── started.tpl
    │   ├── time.tpl
    │   └── tres.tpl
    └── text
        ├── ended-array-summary.tpl
        ├── ended-array.tpl
        ├── ended-hetjob.tpl
        ├── ended.tpl
        ├── invalid-dependency.tpl
        ├── job-output.tpl
        ├── job-table.tpl
        ├── never-ran.tpl
        ├── signature.tpl
        ├── staged-out.tpl
        ├── started-array-summary.tpl
        ├── started-array.tpl
        ├── started-hetjob.tpl
        ├── started.tpl
        ├── time.tpl
        └── tres.tpl
```

By default, the library will look for a `slurm-mail` folder at the following locations, in order of precedence:

```bash
./etc/slurm-mail
../etc/slurm-mail
/etc/slurm-mail
```

> **_NOTE:_** The first two paths listed above are tested relative to the directory of the _executing script_. If neither directory exists then we fall back to using `/etc/slurm-mail`. See also the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section of this document.

Once the location of the `slurm-mail` directory has been established all of the configuration is read from a single `slurm-mail.conf` file inside it.

Edit `slurm-mail.conf` to suit your needs. For example, check that the location of `sacct` is correct. If you are installing from source check that the log and spool directories are set to your desired values.

Finally, you should set/update the value of `MailProg` in your `slurm.conf` file to `/usr/bin/slurm-spool-mail`. By default the Slurm config file will be located at `/etc/slurm/slurm.conf`.

Restart `slurmctld`:

```bash
systemctl restart slurmctld
```

Slurm-Mail will now log e-mail requests from Slurm users to the directory defined as `spoolDir` in the `common` section of `slurm-mail.conf` (`/var/spool/slurm-mail` by default).

The cron job created during installation at `/etc/cron.d/slurm-mail` will execute once per minute to process the spool files, thus making sure that `slurmctld` is not blocked by processing e-mails.

## Environment Variables

Some of the default behaviour described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section can be modified through the use of the following environment variables:

### SLURMMAIL_CONF_DIR

Explicitly defines the location of the top-level `slurm-mail` directory containing all of the necessary config files. See tree in [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### SLURMMAIL_CONF_FILE

Explicitly defines the path to `slurm-mail.conf`. Overrides the default value of `${SLURMMAIL_CONF_DIR}/slurm-mail.conf`.

### SLURMMAIL_HTML_TEMPLATE_DIR

Explicitly defines the directory containing HTML template files. Overrides the default value of `${SLURMMAIL_CONF_DIR}/templates/html`.

### SLURMMAIL_TEXT_TEMPLATE_DIR

Explicitly defines the directory containing text template files. Overrides the default value of `${SLURMMAIL_CONF_DIR}/templates/text`.

## SMTP Settings

By default Slurm-Mail will send e-mails to a mail server running on the same host as Slurm-Mail is installed on, i.e. `localhost`.

You can edit the `smtp` configuration options in `slurm-mail.conf`. For example, to send e-mails via Gmail's SMTP server set the following settings:

```
smtpServer = smtp.gmail.com
smtpPort = 587
smtpUseTls = yes
smtpUserName = your_email@gmail.com
smtpPassword = your_gmail_password
```

> **_NOTE:_**  As this file will contain your Gmail password make sure that it has the correct owner, group and file access permissions.

If your SMTP server does not require a login, leave `smtpUserName` and `smtpPassword` set to null, i.e.

```
smtpUserName =
smtpPassword =
```

For SMTP servers that use SSL rather than starttls please set `smtpUseSsl = yes`.

## E-mail retries

By default Slurm-Mail will attempt to resend e-mails when a previous attempt failed. This can result in repeated failed e-mail attempts if for example a user has specified an invalid e-mail address.

If you would prefer to disable this feature, set the following option in `slurm-mail.conf`:

```
retryOnFailure = no
```

In either case, errors for failed e-mail delivery will always be logged in `/var/log/slurm-mail/slurm-send-mail.log`

You can add a time delay between retries by setting the `retryDelay` option in `slurm-mail.conf` to a value greater than equal to `0` and less than or equal to `20`. The value is specified in seconds and is disabled by default.

**Note**: If e-mail delivery fails for several e-mails and `retryDelay` is a large value this could lead to more than one copy of `slurm-send-mail` being executed. You should consider decreasing the frequency that `slurm-send-mail` is executed by updating `/etc/cron.d/slurm-mail`

## E-mail headers

To add additional e-mail headers to outgoing e-mails please set the `emailHeaders` option in `slurm-mail.conf`

## Customising E-mails

### Templates

Slurm-Mail uses Python's [string.Template](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings) class to create the e-mails it sends. Under Slurm-Mail's `/etc/slurm-mail/templates` directory you will find the following files that you can edit to customise e-mails to your needs under the `html` and `text` directories. Templates under the `html` directory are used for HTML e-mails and the templates under `text` are used for plain text e-mails.

| Filename                  | Template Purpose                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ended-array.tpl           | Used for jobs in an array that have finished.                     |
| ended-array_summary.tpl   | Used when all jobs in an array have finished.                     |
| ended-hetjob.tpl          | Used for the leader job in a heterogeneous job that has ended.    |
| ended.tpl                 | Used for jobs that have finished.                                 |
| invalid-dependency.tpl    | Used when a job has an invalid dependency.                        |
| job-table.tpl             | Used to create the job info table in e-mails.                     |
| never-ran.tpl             | Used for jobs that never ran.                                     |
| signature.tpl             | Used to create the e-mail signature.                              |
| staged-out.tpl            | Used when a job's burst buffer stage has completed.               |
| started.tpl               | Used for jobs that have started.                                  |
| started-hetjob.tpl        | Used for the leader job in a heterogeneous job that has started.  |                                 |
| started-array-summary.tpl | Used when the first job in an array has started.                  |
| started-array.tpl         | Used for the first job in an array that has started.              |
| time.tpl                  | Used when a job reaches a percentage of its time limit.           |
| tres.tpl                  | Used to add trackable resources (TRES) information to e-mails.    |

Each template has a number of variables which can be used in the generation of e-mails. Please see [TEMPLATES](TEMPLATES.md) for futher details.

### Styling

You can adjust the font style, size, colours etc. by editing the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file `/etc/slurm-mail/style.css` used for generating the e-mails.

### Date/time format

To change the date/time format used for job start and end times in the e-mails, change the `datetimeFormat` configuration option in `slurm-mail.conf`. The format string used is the same as Python's [datetime.strftime function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior).

### E-mail subject

To change the subject of the e-mails, set the `emailSubject` configuration option in `slurm-mail.conf`. The following placeholders are available for use in the string:

| Place holder | Value                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| $CLUSTER     | The name of the cluster |
| $JOB_NAME    | The name of the job     |
| $JOB_ID      | The Slurm ID of the job |
| $STATE       | The state of the job    |

## Validating E-mails

By default Slurm-Mail will not perform any checks on the destination e-mail address (i.e the value supplied to `sbatch` via `--mail-user`). If you would like Slurm-Mail to only send e-mails for jobs that correspond to a valid e-mail address (e.g. user@some.domain) then you can set the `validateEmail` option in `slurm-mail.conf` to `true`. E-mail addresses that failed this check will be logged in `/var/log/slurm-mail/slurm-send-mail.log` as an error.

The regular expression used to validate e-mail addresses can be configured by adjusting the `emailRegEx` value in `slurm-mail.conf`.

## Including Job Output in E-mails

In `slurm-mail.conf` you can set the `includeOutputLines` to the number of lines to include from the end of each job's standard out and standard error files.

Notes:

* if the user has decided to use the same file for both standard output and standard error then there will be only one section of job output in the job completion e-mails.
* Job output can only be included if the process that is running `slurm-send-mail.py` is able to read the user's output files.
* Due to the way `scontrol` reports filenames that use Slurm's [filename patterns](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#SECTION_%3CB%3Efilename-pattern%3C/B%3E) only these patterns are supported when including job output in e-mails: `%A`, `%a`, `%j`, `%u`, and `%x`.

## Job Arrays

Slurm-Mail will honour the behaviour of `--mail-type` option of `sbatch` for job arrays. If a user specifies `--mail-type=ARRAY_TASKS` then Slurm-Mail will send notification e-mails for all jobs in the array. If you want to limit the number of e-mails that will be sent in this scenario then change the `arrayMaxNotifications` parameter in `slurm-mail.conf` to a value greater than zero.

## GECOS Field Usage

Slurm-Mail uses the [GECOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field) field of a user's passwd entry to determine their real name to use in e-mails. Slurm-Mail will split the [GECOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field) field by the comma character and will by default use the first (zeroth) element. If your system is set-up to use a different element for the user's real name then you can change the `gecosNameField` parameter in `slurm-mail.conf` to your desired value.

For example, if your [GECOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field) uses the format `Last name, first name` you can set `gecosNameField` to `1` instead of `0`.

# Development

Clone this repository to your desktop and make sure you have a supported version of Python installed (see *Requirements* above).

Pull requests are welcome!

A VSCode settings file is provided in this repository and is configured to allow you to run unit tests from the GUI.

## Linting

`pylint` is used to check that the Slurm-Mail Python source code is formatted correctly.

```bash
pip3 install --user pylint
```

Once install you can run `pylint` against the Slurm-Mail source code:

```bash
pylint setup.py src/slurmmail/*.py tests/unit/*.py tests/integration/docker-slurm/*.py tests/integration/*.py
```

## Testing

In order to run the unit tests you will need to install `pytest` and `pytest-cov`, e.g.

```bash
pip3 install --user pytest pytest-cov
```

The unit tests can be found at [tests/unit](tests/unit) and can be invoked from either VSCode or from the command line, e.g.

```bash
pytest
```

Integration tests can be found at [tests/integration](tests/integration) which also contains a `demo.sh` script which allows you to experiment with a demo of Slurm-Mail complete with [MailHog](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/) as a working mail server and webmail client.

## Upgrading from Slurm-Mail version 3 to 4

Version 4.0 onwards **no longer installs** to the `/opt/slurm-mail`. Instead from version 4.0 onwards install using Python's `setuptools` module. If your current Slurm-Mail 3.x installation was installed by your operating system's package manager, then you can just upgrade your installation using your package manager (e.g. `yum`, `dnf`).

If not, then proceed as follows:

1. install Slurm-Mail 4 using one of the methods describe above - take note of where the scripts and config files are installed (e.g. `/usr/bin` and `/etc`).

2. If you **have not** modified any template files you can skip this step.

```bash
cp /opt/slurm-mail/conf.d/templates/* /etc/slurm-mail/templates/html/
```

Now check the contents of the plain text templates located at `/etc/slurm-mail/templates/text` and adjust as necessary to meet your requirements.

3. If you **have not** modified Slurm-Mail's `style.css` file you can skip this step.

```bash
cp /opt/slurm-mail/conf.d/style.css /etc/slurm-mail/
```

4. If you **have not** modified `slurm-mail.conf` you can skip this step.

```
cp /opt/slurm-mail/conf.d/slurm-mail.conf /etc/slurm-mail/
```

5. Update your Slurm installation's `slurm.conf` file:

```
MailProg=/usr/bin/slurm-spool-mail
```

Now restart `slurmctld`:

```bash
systemctl restart slurmctld
```

6. Edit `/etc/cron.d/slurm-mail` and set the path of the executable to: `/usr/bin/slurm-send-mail`

7. If you are sure you will no longer need the old version:

```
rm -rf /opt/slurm-mail
```

## Upgrading from Slurm-Mail version 4.0-4.9 to 4.10

Starting from version 4.10, HTML and plain text e-mail templates are provided. If you have adjusted any templates please copy them from `/etc/slurm-mail/templates` to `/etc/slurm-mail/templates/html` and adjust any of the plain text templates as necessary under `/etc/slurm-mail/templates/text`.

## Troubleshooting

1. Check that spool files are being created under: `/var/spool/slurm-mail`. If they are not:

* check `cron` is working
* check for invocation of `/usr/bin/slurm-spool-mail` in the `slurmctld` logs

2. If spool files are being created but not purged please comment out `logFile` in the `[slurm-send-mail]` section in `slurm-mail.conf` and run (as root): `/usr/bin/slurm-send-mail -v` at the console.

3. If `/usr/bin/slurm-send-mail` is executing ok but you are not receiving e-mails, then check the mail logs on your server for any mail delivery errors.
