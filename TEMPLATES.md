# Template Variables

Each template has a number of variables which are are used during e-mail generation. The following sub sections detail which variables are available to which templates. You can use these to customise the templates to your individual requirements.

HTML and plain text templates can be found, by default, at: `/etc/slurm-mail/templates/html` and `/etc/slurm-mail/templates/text`.

> **_NOTE_**: These locations can be modified through the use of the `SLURMMAIL_HTML_TEMPLATE_DIR` and `SLURMMAIL_TEXT_TEMPLATE_DIR` environment variables, respectively. See README.md for more details.
